## Preparation of user's computer

The general analysis section of NIG supercomputer can be used with a computer running a SSH client and a web browser. We recommend a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with 16GB or more main memory.

- Mac and Linux computers can be accessed using a standard terminal emulator.
- Windows computers can be accessed using PowerShell SSH client or Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2 (WSL2), etc.


## Steps from user account application to start of use
1. Apply for <a href="https://sc2.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index.php/ja-new-application">the application form of new user registration to register your application</a>.
    - Before you fill it in, ensure "[User Account Issuance Criteria](../application/application.md)" and "[Acceptable Use Policy](/application/use_policy)".
    - You can use the e-mail address of your institution, not a free e-mail address. (except in special cases)
    - When applying to use the NIG supercomputer, you must designate a faculty member of a university or national/public research institution who is a resident of Japan under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law as the responsible person. A UNIX group is created for each account of the responsible person.

2. To confirm your identity, the person in charge of the NIG supercomputer send email to [the responsible person](../application/application.md#責任者について). The pleage(PDF) should be signed and sent back by them.
    - The email will be sent in a few days After completing the application form

3. Wait for your account registration certificate to arrive.
    - It takes about a week to mail your account registration certidicate by post after you sent the pledge(PDF).
    - It takes longer time if the examination is required by the Organization such as foreign exchange law.
4. Confirm your initial password with your account registration card and start using the service.
    - When you start using, register your SSH public key first. For details, see ["SSH public key registration"](../application/ssh_keys.md).
    - For how to login the general analysis section, refer to the pages after [How to Login (The general analysis section)](/general_analysis_division/ga_login).
5. If you have a request to expand the resources or use billing services, [download the Usage Plan Form](../application/resource_extension.md), fill it out, and submit it.
    - [Contact information](../application/reference.md) for Submission e-mail adress.
