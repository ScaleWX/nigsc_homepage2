For security traceability reasons, we ask you to designate a responsible person when applying for use.
[<u>For more information on how to designate a responsible person, see here</u>](/en/application/#the-responsible-person).

- Click the check box in the following cases. After clicking the check box, the screen shown on the left is displayed. Then enter the information of the responsible person.
  - If the account name of the responsible person is known, but the group name is unknown.
  - If neither the account name nor the group name of the responsible person is known.
  - Note: If an incorrect email address is entered, the application information can be compromised due to erroneous transmission, for which no liability can be accepted.

- If you do not know the account name of the responsible person and the group name, [<u>refer to FAQ</u>](/faq/faq_NewUser_registration/#what-should-i-enter-account-name-and-group-name-of-the-responsible-person).
