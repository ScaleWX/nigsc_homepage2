## Unable to communicate.

Since multiple ports (e.g. port 33001 in addition to the ssh port) are used for data transfer, these ports must be free in the network settings of the university/research institute, etc.

## Communication speed is not fast enough

To actually achieve a transfer rate of several Gbps, the server and network equipment need to be tuned on the local machine side.
