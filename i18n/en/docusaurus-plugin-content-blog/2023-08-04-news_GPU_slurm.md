Since the number of users of GPU nodes is increasing due to the free Parabricks, we have created only for GPU nodes in the Personal Genome Analysis section so that more researchers can use the GPU node.

This new Slurm partition only charges for the time when the computation is actually running.

This reduces the time occupied by the GPU node and allows more people to use the GPU.

Along with this, the fee structure for GPU nodes has been changed from the second phase of the project.
